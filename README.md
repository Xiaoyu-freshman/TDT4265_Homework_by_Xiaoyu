# TDT4265_Homework_XIaoyu
# This folder is just the record about the Assignments and final project of TDT4265 (NTNU)
# I divided the Assignments into Assignment 1, 2, 3 and 4, as well as one final project.
# The most interesting part is in the folder named Assignment3, in which there is a code to use the Optuna, a new tools for hyperparameters automatically searching. To implement this tool into PyTorch, I have searched on Google for several times. And finally, I found a blogs in Janpanese (Link:https://qiita.com/eduidl/items/9c684a6467a63acd28f2) which talked about how to use this tool into their research.
